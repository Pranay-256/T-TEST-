# T-TEST-

The T-test is a statistical tool very similar to the Z-test, but it is used when you have less information about the larger group (the population). It determines if the average of a sample is significantly different from a known value or if the averages of two samples are different from each other.

Key Idea
Like the Z-test, the T-test asks: "Is the difference I'm seeing real, or is it just random noise?"

When to Use It (The Key Difference)
You use a T-test primarily when:

You have a small amount of data (a small sample size, typically less than 30).

You do NOT know the standard deviation of the entire population. You must rely on the variability (standard deviation) calculated only from your small sample.

How It Works (Conceptually)
It calculates a value called the T-score. This score is similar to the Z-score, but its calculation accounts for the extra uncertainty that comes from using a small sample or not knowing the population's true variability.

Because of this uncertainty, the T-test uses a T-distribution (which has "fatter tails" than the normal Z-distribution) to evaluate the T-score. This makes the test slightly more cautious, requiring a larger difference before declaring it "significant."

If the T-score is far from zero, and the corresponding P-value is low, you decide that the difference is statistically significant (meaning you reject the idea that the two values are the same).
